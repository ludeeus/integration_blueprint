# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "blueprint" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! 😎

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "blueprint" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)

## Development Scripts

This repository uses the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern for common development tasks:

- `scripts/bootstrap` - One-time setup after cloning (installs dependencies and pre-commit hooks)
- `scripts/setup` - Set up the project for the first time after cloning
- `scripts/update` - Update dependencies to their latest versions
- `scripts/lint` - Run linting and auto-format code
- `scripts/lint-check` - Check linting without making changes (for CI)
- `scripts/develop` - Start Home Assistant in development mode
- `scripts/help` - Display available scripts and their descriptions

All scripts automatically use the modern [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager for faster dependency management.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run linting checks before each commit. The hooks are automatically installed when you run `scripts/bootstrap`. You can also:

- Install hooks manually: `pre-commit install`
- Run hooks on all files: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## How?

1. Create a new repository in GitHub, using this repository as a template by clicking the "Use this template" button in the GitHub UI.
1. Open your new repository in Visual Studio Code devcontainer (Preferably with the "`Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume...`" option).
1. Rename all instances of the `integration_blueprint` to `custom_components/<your_integration_domain>` (e.g. `custom_components/awesome_integration`).
1. Rename all instances of the `Integration Blueprint` to `<Your Integration Name>` (e.g. `Awesome Integration`).
1. Run the `scripts/develop` to start HA and test out your new integration.

## Next steps

These are some next steps you may want to look into:
- Add tests to your integration, [`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component) can help you get started.
- Add brand images (logo/icon) to https://github.com/home-assistant/brands.
- Create your first release.
- Share your integration on the [Home Assistant Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/).
- Submit your integration to [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/start).
